## Problem Statement

It will allow for users to find the best deal of what they want to buy. If other users have tracked the item before, it should be able to share that price history with other users.  Additionally, the chrome extension could send an email or an alert to chrome that the price has dropped so that the user can take advantage of the deal immediately.
